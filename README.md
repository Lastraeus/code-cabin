# Code Cabin - PP4: Iteration 1

## [Link to live website](https://code-cabin-d74544e083a8.herokuapp.com//)

## **Purpose of the Project**

To create a booking website for a "Code Cabin" company, where users can sign up to book a relaxing stay in a lovely remote Irish cabin (With top-tier broadband and amenities of-course!), so they can get away from a busy distracting life, and have something of a getaway holiday, just them and their coding needs.
Users will be able to book, view, update and delete their own bookings on a user profile page.
Users will be able to publicly rate their stays/experiences with the Code Cabin (after staff approval/screening) as well as submit comments/feedback directly to the site owners.

## **Features**

Section To be completed --

- Input any valid booking selection on the "Booking" Page. This is silently stored in the backend, pending future "availability validation". The user is then currently forwarded to the home/index page.

- Register, Login, Logout, with the relevant nav buttons.

- View a tranquil page of nothing but some peaceful static links. Very soothing.

Ideas for future possible features include;

## **Testing**

### **General Testing Process**

Primary testing through the development process was done via the CodeAnywhere python terminal, running the Django server locally.
python3 manage.py runserver. With followup testing on the Heroku Live site, after update deployment.

I would then test to see that changes reflected design intent. (IE check newly added features work, database was correctly updated etc.

Automated testing and comprehensive overall testing regime to be ramped up. Possible Test Driven Development in future iterations.

### **Hardware**

This application was tested primarily tested using;

- my Desktop PC (Windows 10 1440p widescreen monitor) (Firefox & Chrome)
- My Google Pixel 6a Phone (firefox)

Heroku

1. Create a free https://heroku.com/ account, and validate it (You may want to investigate your organization's student credits policy if you have access to any)
2. Set password after validating email.
3. On the Heroku Dashboard default screen, click "create app"
4. go to the settings screen and down to the config vars section.
5. Add a "CREDS" var and as the arg add your credentials if you have any. I would recommend trying to stick to one set of creds and one file if possible.
6. Add a "PORT" var and give it the arg 8000.
7. if you are using custom additional creds, add the lines of code I screenshot above in "bugs encountered" to your controllers/default.js file in get pod.
8. Add the custom var names and args to the heroku.com settings page as above for CREDS.

9. Move to the deployment tab
10. Enable automatic deploys, then this time, hit the manually deploy page.
11. When it's finished, click the "open the app" link and view your template page.
